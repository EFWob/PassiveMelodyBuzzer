sentence=An ESP32/ESP8266 specific library for playing melodies (nonblocking) using a passive buzzer.
paragraph=Sound generation is driven by timer interrupt to allow for high precision in timing and pitch. That makes it possible to play melodies using a simple notation in ASCII. Playback is nonblocking, so you can do other things while the buzzer is humming its tune. See examples. ToDo: port to platforms other than ESP32 and README in English.
